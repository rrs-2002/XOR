# XOR Neural Network Implementation (TensorFlow)

This project implements an XOR gate using a simple neural network in TensorFlow with GPU support.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (with GPU support recommended)
- NumPy

## Installation
Install TensorFlow and dependencies:
```sh
pip install tensorflow numpy
```

## Code Overview
The implementation includes:
1. Defining XOR input and output datasets.
2. Creating a simple neural network with one hidden layer (2 neurons) and an output layer (1 neuron) using TensorFlow.
3. Compiling the model using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.
4. Training the model for 5000 epochs.
5. Running predictions on the XOR dataset.

## Running the Model
Run the script using:
```sh
python xor_nn.py
```
The model will train and print the accuracy of predictions.

## Output Example
```
Epoch 1/5000
1/1 [==============================] - 0s 28ms/step - loss: 0.0891 - accuracy: 1.0000
...
Predictions:
 [0 1 1 0]
```
